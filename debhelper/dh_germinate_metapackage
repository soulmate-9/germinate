=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_germinate_metapackage> [S<B<debhelper options>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_germinate_metapackage is a debhelper program that generates
${germinate:Depends} substitutions and adds them to substvars files.

The program will read the C<metapackage-map> file that should have been
created by a previous run of C<germinate-update-metapackage> for your
package, and for each seed listed there it will generate dependencies and
recommendations based on the previous results of
C<germinate-update-metapackage>. Dependencies will be substituted into your
package's control file wherever you place the token "${germinate:Depends}",
and similarly recommendations will be substituted wherever you place the
token "${germinate:Recommends}".

You must run C<germinate-update-metapackage> before building the source
package. Normally, source packages that use this program will include an
C<update> script that will call it with appropriate arguments.

=head1 EXAMPLES

dh_germinate_metapackage is usually called indirectly in a rules file via
the dh command.

	%:
		dh $@ --with germinate

You must build-depend on at least debhelper (>= 7.0.8) to use this form, and
in any case you must build-depend on at least germinate (>= 1.18) to use
this program at all.

It can also be called directly at any time between C<dh_prep> and
C<dh_installdeb>.

	install: build
		dh_testdir
		dh_testroot
		dh_prep
		dh_installdirs
		dh_germinate_metapackage

	binary-arch: build install
		...

	$seeds{$metapackage} = $seed;
}
close MAP;

foreach my $package (@{$dh{DOPACKAGES}}) {
	next unless exists $seeds{$package};
	my $seed = $seeds{$package};
	my $arch = package_arch($package);

	open DEPENDS, "$seed-$arch" or die "Can't open $seed-$arch: $!";
	while (<DEPENDS>) {
		chomp;
		s/^\s*//; s/\s*$//;
		addsubstvar($package, "germinate:Depends", $_);
	}
	close DEPENDS;

	open RECOMMENDS, "$seed-recommends-$arch" or die "Can't open $seed-recommends-$arch: $!";
	while (<RECOMMENDS>) {
		chomp;
		s/^\s*//; s/\s*$//;
		addsubstvar($package, "germinate:Recommends", $_);
	}
	close RECOMMENDS;
