  * Stop fetching Suggests from Packages; we don't use it.
  * Build a cache of seed entries when analysing reverse-dependencies, so
    that we don't have to expensively call get_seed_entries once per package
    per seed (LP: #915569).
  * Convert to setuptools.
  * Add the beginnings of a test suite.
  * Make the main bodies of scripts into modules so that they can be tested
    more easily.
  * Remove private AtomicUTF8File class; just write all files as UTF-8.

  * Port to Python 3:
    - Use "raise Exception(value)" syntax rather than the old-style "raise
      Exception, value".
    - Use Python 3-style print functions.
    - Use a list comprehension rather than filter (which behaves differently
      in Python 3).
    - Make GraphCycleError a subclass of Exception rather than of
      StandardError.
    - Simplify stringiness tests in TagFile.__init__ and Seed.__init__ using
      basestring.
    - Implement rich comparison methods instead of __cmp__ for Seed and
      GerminatedSeed.  (Seed needs all of them for interface-compatibility;
      GerminatedSeed only needs __eq__ and __ne__.)
    - Use Python 3 replacements for urllib, urllib2, and ConfigParser if
      available.
    - When decompressing tag files from the archive, explicitly treat
      everything as binary data.
    - In Python 3, decode seed data read from URLs as UTF-8.
    - Pass universal_newlines=True to subprocess.Popen to get Unicode
      output.
    - Make sure to close stdout of subprocess.Popen objects.
    - Use 2to3 to handle the few remaining 2/3 differences at build time.

    it's encountered to either the end of the seed or the next

germinate (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Call superclass constructor in GerminateFormatter's constructor.
  * Build-depend on python-all.
  * Store instances of Seed as GerminatedSeed._raw_seed, rather than
    instances of BytesIO which are transient and won't compare the way we
    need them to.
  * Remove build-sources entries that also appear in sources outputs at
    output time rather than immediately, which has the effect of removing
    sources that appear in any seed in the structure rather than just those
    processed earlier.  This fixes behaviour when processing multiple seed
    structures, but also seems to fit more closely with the original intent
    of build-sources as documented in README, which I think was broken all
    the way back in r70 when seed hierarchies were first allowed to fork.
  * Fix inclusion/exclusion of packages from seeds other than "extra".

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 07 Dec 2011 00:51:12 +0000

germinate (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure to always close files after finishing with them.  Mostly this
    is done using the 'with' statement in Python 2.6, but pychecker gets
    unhappy with contextlib.closing so I carried on using traditional
    try/finally blocks in cases that would require that.
  * Remove all uses of os.system and os.popen, replacing them with uses of
    the better-designed subprocess module.
  * Remove all code supporting the germinate -i/--ipv6 option; this has been
    off by default since November 2004, the service behind this was
    discontinued in March 2007
    (http://lists.debian.org/debian-ipv6/2007/02/msg00015.html), and
    germinate was never a great place to track this kind of thing anyway.
  * Convert all option parsing to optparse.  Consolidate defaults into a new
    Germinate.defaults module.
  * Update copyright dates.
  * Move canonical source location from people.canonical.com to a hosted
    branch on Launchpad.
  * Slightly modernise use of dh_python2.
  * Forbid seed names containing slashes.
  * Eliminate most uses of list.sort() in favour of sorted(iterable).
  * When promoting dependencies from lesser seeds, remove them from the
    lesser seed lists at output time rather than immediately.  This is
    mostly to make it easier to process multiple seed structures, but also
    fixes a long-standing bug where promoted dependencies were only removed
    from a single arbitrary lesser seed rather than from all possible ones.
  * Memoise the results of Germinator's _inner_seeds, _strictly_outer_seeds,
    and _outer_seeds methods.  This saves nearly a third of germinate's
    runtime in common cases.
  * Write all output files atomically.
  * Change default distribution to precise.
  * Update kubuntu-meta example in germinate-update-metapackage(1).
  * Refer to versioned GPL file in debian/copyright.
  * Policy version 3.9.2: no changes required.

  * Massive API cleanup:
    - Move output-writing functions from the top-level germinate program
      into Germinator.
    - Redesign how Germinator gets Packages/Sources sections from the
      archive.  This now works via an abstract interface, which should make
      it easier to plug in alternative archive sources (e.g. a database).
    - Move all apt_pkg interaction into library code.  Germinator.__init__
      now takes an architecture argument so that it can set
      APT::Architecture.
    - Turn open_seed into a Seed class, allowing it to be a context manager.
    - Move code pertaining to the structure of seeds into a SeedStructure
      class, simplifying the interface.
    - Make all module names lower-case, per PEP-8.  Remove the separate
      Germinate.Archive.tagfile module; this is now in germinate.archive
      directly.  Adjust build system and pychecker handling to support this.
    - Remove unnecessary logging helper functions.
    - Don't modify level names on the root logger simply as a result of
      importing germinate.germinator; move this into a function.
    - Prefix all private methods with an underscore.
    - Remove germinate.tsort from germinate's public API.
    - Convert all method names to the PEP-8 preferred style (method_name
      rather than methodName).
    - Introduce wrapper functions for the various uses of write_list and
      write_source_list, and make the underlying methods private.
    - Make most instance variables private by prefixing an underscore,
      adding a few accessor methods.
    - Convert build system to distutils, make the germinate Python package
      public, and create a new python-germinate binary package.
    - Improve the Seed class so that seeds can be read multiple times
      without having to redownload them, and so that they remember which
      branch they came from.
    - Don't modify inner seeds when processing outer ones; filter
      build-dependencies on output instead.
    - Don't plant or grow seeds that have already had functionally-identical
      versions planted or grown respectively.
    - Automatically convert string dists/components/mirrors/source_mirrors
      arguments to lists in TagFile constructor.
    - Make it possible for a single Germinator to process multiple seed
      structures, reusing the work done on common seeds.
    - Canonicalise mirrors (by appending '/' if necessary) in TagFile rather
      than in the main germinate program.
    - Handle the extra seed entirely within Germinator rather than modifying
      SeedStructure (which doesn't fit well with processing the same seed
      structure on multiple architectures).
    - Use module-level loggers.
    - Get rid of the custom PROGRESS log level.
    - Change germinate.archive to use logging rather than print.
    - Add docstrings for all public classes and methods, and tidy up a few
      existing ones per PEP-257.

germinate (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check whether versions in dependencies are satisfied (LP: #74514).
  * Exclude Essential packages from metapackage dependencies (LP: #42261).
  * Make metapackage changelog entries more concise by merging items for
    multiple architectures (LP: #217963).
  * Print a helpful error message if an ssh connection fails, on the
    assumption that it's often due to an incorrect username (LP: #99123).
  * Document fetching seeds from the local file system (closes: #363536).
  * Add an example of using --seed-packages.
  * Change default distribution to intrepid. Update kubuntu-meta example in
    germinate-update-metapackage(1).
  * With all reported Ubuntu bugs fixed and only one organisationally-tricky
    Debian bug left, I think it's about time to bump the version to 1.0.

germinate (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change Maintainer address back to cjwatson@ubuntu.com; I generally work
    on this package on work time.
  * germinate-update-metapackage honours new Task-Seeds and Task-Metapackage
    seed headers, replacing previous seed_map/* and metapackage_map/*
    entries in update.cfg.
  * Fix error message on failing to download non-bzr seeds.
  * Update kubuntu-meta example in germinate-update-metapackage(1).
  * Simplify germinate-update-metapackage changelog output when a package
    moves from depends to recommends or vice versa.
  * Remove obsolete dh_python call from debian/rules.

germinate (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Plant seeds in topologically-sorted order. The intent of this change is
    the same as that in 0.40, only this time it should actually work in the
    face of seeds that inherit from other seeds that are overridden in a
    different branch.
  * On the other hand, continue to use the last entry in the source
    STRUCTURE file as the supported seed. It may not be topologically last
    if there are seeds in included branches that are not inherited by
    supported.
  * Remove overridden entries from 'structure' output file.

germinate (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * Use 'bzr checkout --lightweight' to speed up seed checkouts.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Allow "metapackage_map/SEED" configuration file entries in
    update-metapackage, which can be used to generate output metapackages
    whose names do not match the generating seed names.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Feb 2008 14:38:56 +0000

germinate (0.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix germination from multiple seed sources in bzr mode.
  * germinate-update-metapackage now automatically expands the seeds option
    for seed inheritance, so you no longer usually need to have separate
    seeds and output_seeds options in update.cfg.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Feb 2008 11:30:53 +0000

germinate (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Output a .seedtext file for each seed, containing the verbatim text of
    the seed.

germinate (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add special-case handling of supported+build-depends to
    germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add -S/--seed-source, -s/--seed-dist, and -d/--dist options to
    germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add support for germinating from multiple seed sources as well as
    multiple branches. This is needed to support "third-party" seed branches
    that are stored in a different location from branches they include.
  * Fix rescuing of packages from extra, broken in 0.32.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Jan 2008 21:53:30 +0000

germinate (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make germinate-update-metapackage only blacklist the metapackage being
    generated, not all metapackages. See LP #148075.
  * Change default distribution to hardy.
  * Vcs-Bzr is now an official field.
  * Fix 'structure' output file; records were being separated by the empty
    string rather than by newlines, which made it rather useless.
  * Add an 'include' facility to the STRUCTURE file to allow seeds from one
    branch to inherit from seeds in another branch.
  * Automatically compute the transitive closure of inheritance
    relationships in the STRUCTURE file, rather than requiring them to be
    written out by hand. In other words, if you have 'minimal: required'
    then you can simply write 'standard: minimal' rather than 'standard:
    required minimal'. This is a requirement for sane use of 'include',
    since it may not be straightforward to hardcode the inheritance
    relationships among seeds in another branch.
  * Unhardcode the 'supported' seed. The last seed in the STRUCTURE file is
    now used for build-depends calculations.
  * Policy version 3.7.3: no changes required.

germinate (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dch -iU rather than dch -U. (I use
    DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC=changelog so never noticed the problem.)
  * Fix germinate-pkg-diff --mode option (was incorrectly --mirror, contrary
    to its meaning and the documentation).
  * Make germinate-pkg-diff work again even if supported is not in its list
    of seeds.
  * germinate-pkg-diff now automatically adds inherited seeds as necessary.
    Thus, the default list of seeds is reduced to simply 'desktop'.
  * Download package index files to a temporary directory if they aren't
    going to be saved.
  * Clean up package index files downloaded for germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add germinate-pkg-diff -a/--arch option.
  * Update copyright dates.

  * Generalise Extra-Include and Extra-Exclude to allow rescuing packages
    from any seed, not just extra. For example, Mobile-Include: *-dev will
    rescue all packages from sources that generate binaries named *-dev in
    the mobile output.

  * Try to fall back to alternative dependencies if one is blacklisted.
  * Honour blacklist entries even if they're explicitly seeded.
  * Don't apply blacklists (apart from the "supported" blacklist) to
    build-dependencies.
  * Be a little more verbose when blacklisting packages.
  * Allow "seed_map/SEED" configuration file entries in update-metapackage
    to have an output metapackage read its package list from multiple seeds
    (needed for splitting required and minimal in the Ubuntu seeds).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jun 2007 20:56:11 +0100

germinate (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for negative architecture specifications, e.g. [!powerpc].
  * Document % and [arch] seed syntaxes in germinate(1).
  * Add support for prefixing seed entries with "!" to enforce blacklisting
    packages from the containing seed and any of its inner seeds. For
    example, this allows a package to be in Ubuntu main but blacklisted from
    being shipped on CDs.
  * Change default distribution to gutsy.

    This avoids slews of warnings for binaries that only exist on other

  * Fix crash when promoting from lesser seeds.
  * Include recommends in main outputs (they should continue to appear in
    Task headers and such, just not in metapackage dependencies), and create
    a .seed-recommends output for just the seeded recommendations.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Sep 2006 15:28:57 +0100

germinate (0.21ubuntu1) edgy; urgency=low

germinate (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add optional output_seeds setting (defaults to value of seeds) in

    without being output.
  * Sort added and removed packages in metapackage changelogs.

germinate (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Consider sources from inner seeds while rescuing packages from extra (so
    e.g. in Ubuntu Extra-Include in supported should look at source packages
    from minimal etc. as well as from supported).
  * Rescue from sources in the build tree in a separate pass, and add
    rescued packages to the depends/build-depends lists rather than
    pretending that they're explicitly seeded. This means that rescued
    packages end up correctly in supported or supported+build-depends
    depending on whether their source packages were found while processing
    dependencies or build-dependencies.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Jul 2006 13:08:34 +0100

germinate (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow shell-style globs in seeds wherever regular expressions are
    allowed. (Regular expressions are surrounded by /.../, making this
    unambiguous.)
  * Add support for Extra-Include and Extra-Exclude variables, which allow
    automatically rescuing packages that match certain patterns from extra
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/seed-cleanup).
  * Tweak logging priorities for messages about virtual seed entries.
  * Don't display debugging messages by default; add germinate -v/--verbose
    option to display them.
  * Use sets rather than lists where possible. This roughly halves the
    runtime for the Ubuntu seeds.
  * Add extras recursively: binaries generated by sources pulled in by
    dependencies or build-dependencies of extra binaries should themselves
    be extra.

  * Fix d-i kernel version pruning to happen early enough to exclude seeded
    packages for the wrong kernel version (which can easily happen e.g. if

  * If no Kernel-Version variable is given, allow all udebs with
    Kernel-Version headers rather than none of them.

  * Switch from urllib to urllib2.
  * Refactor duplicated seed-fetching code into new Germinate.seeds module.
  * Add optional seed_dist setting in update.cfg files, to allow setting a
    default seed distribution.

  * When processing the build tree, germinate is (correctly) careful not to
    promote packages from lesser seeds, since we still want to consider them
    (e.g.) part of ship even if they're build-dependencies of desktop.
    However, this sometimes caused us to select the wrong alternative from
    an or-ed build-dependency (e.g. redland Build-Depends:
    libmysqlclient15-dev | libmysqlclient12-dev | libmysqlclient10-dev and
    libmysqlclient15-dev was in the Ubuntu supported seed). To fix this,
    process the packages at that point anyway and just avoid promoting them.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 20 Feb 2006 13:51:30 +0000
